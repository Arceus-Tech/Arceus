# Arceus Site: Powered by Arceus.tech
## Developed by Thawshi Srikanth

Welcome to the Arceus Site repository! This project has been developed by Thawshi Srikanth and powered by Arceus.tech. Below, you'll find important information about the project structure and available commands to help you get started.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project follows a specific structure to organize its code and assets effectively:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### `public/`
This directory is meant for static assets such as images, fonts, and other files that don't require processing by your build tools. You can place any assets that need to be directly served to the client in this folder.

### `src/pages/`
This is where the heart of your application resides. The `src/pages/` directory contains `.astro` (or `.md`) files that define the different pages of your website. Each file in this directory represents a specific route within your application.

### `src/components/`
While not explicitly mentioned in the project structure, you can create and organize your Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components in the `src/components/` directory. This is a common practice to keep your code modular and maintainable.

## ðŸ§ž Commands
